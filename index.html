            ### Overview
            This will be an introductory talk but it will cover
            a lot of ground.

            We're going to talk about how to move from an imperative, callback-based API
            to a functional API that makes use of more elegant methods of composing effects.

            We'll also try and remove some of the noise that generally accompanies code in service-oriented architectures.

            ### The Premise

            We have inherited responsibility for an in-flight project after another
            disastrous outbreak of project management.

            ```scala
            case class Thing(id: String)
            ```

            The goal of the project is to write a service that can retrieve,
            search and save information about the client's very important `Thing`s. Thrilling.

            ### A typical imperative API

            Like Node.js, Vert.x, countless others...
            ```scala
            trait CallbackService {
              def openSession(username: String, password: String, handler: Long => Unit): Unit
              def searchThings(sessionId: Long, searchTerm: String, handler: List[Thing] => Unit): Unit
              def getAThing(sessionId: Long, thingId: String, handler: Thing => Unit): Unit
              def saveAThing(sessionId: Long, thing: Thing, handler: () => Unit): Unit
              def closeSession(sessionId: Long): Unit
            }
            ```

          <script type="text/template">
            ### Accountability

            Returning `Unit` from a `get` method is definitely a bad sign.

            In functional programming it's an indication that we have stepped outside of
            the world of pure, idempotent, easily tested functions into a sea
            of IO, state and Lovecraftian cosmic horror.

            Here we do so because (I am pretending that) there is some underlying asynchronous
            process which performs our effects and calls our continuation with the result.

            ### Reference Implementations

            Let's use these examples to determine the cost of our refactorings later.
            ```scala
            def openSession(username: String, password: String, handler: Long => Unit): Unit = {
              // new Thread(new Runnable { override def ru- yeah, this is why I gave up on Java
              val newSession = System.nanoTime
              sessions += newSession
              handler(newSession)
            }

            def searchThings(sessionId: Long, searchTerm: String, handler: List[Thing] => Unit): Unit = {
              val relevantThings = database.filter { thing =>
                thing.id.toUpperCase.contains(searchTerm.toUpperCase)
              }
              handler(relevantThings.toList)
            }
            ```
          </script>
        </section>

        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
            ### User code
            Please note - Scala's anonymous function syntax makes this look nicer
            than it deserves to look.

            ```scala
            val callbackService = new HappyCallbackService(initialData)
            import callbackService._

            openSession("david", "fpnortheast", sid => {
              searchThings(sid, "ble", things => {
                closeSession(sid)
                things shouldBe List(Thing("indispensible"), Thing("irreplaceable"))
              })
            })
            ```
            You don't want to see what it looks like when we introduce an additional callback on each operation to handle errors.
            Or write it in vanilla JavaScript.

            ### Flattening nested computations

            Here we are carrying around some state with us; in this case the results that we give to our callbacks.

            How can we thread this data through our computation without writing horribly nested code?

            Can we restore a more readable sequential flow of control?

          <script type="text/template">
            ### Context

            To start with, we'll write our code in terms of some type which expresses what the computation is doing.

            If possible, we should use a generic type to ensure that we can express the result type of our operations.

            Sorry Clojurians and Rubyists: the overall technique is not exclusive to statically typed languages at all but it's much easier to explain this way.

            ### A `Try`-based API

            ```scala
            trait Try[+A]
            case class Success[A](value: A) extends Try[A]
            case class Failure(exc: Throwable) extends Try[Nothing]

            trait TryService {
              def openSession(username: String, password: String): Try[Long]
              def searchThings(sessionId: Long, searchTerm: String): Try[List[Thing]]
              def getAThing(sessionId: Long, thingId: String): Try[Thing]
              def saveAThing(sessionId: Long, thing: Thing): Try[Unit]
              def closeSession(sessionId: Long): Try[Unit]
            }
            ```
            Notice how the callbacks are gone. Instead of accepting a callback which requires our result we return a `Try` parameterised by the result type.

            ### Implementations

            This is really a case of spot the difference; there's very little to change.
            ```scala
            def openSession(username: String, password: String) = Try {
              val newSession = System.nanoTime
              sessions += newSession
              newSession
            }

            def searchThings(sessionId: Long, searchTerm: String) = Try {
              database.filter { thing =>
                thing.id.toUpperCase.contains(searchTerm.toUpperCase)
              }.toList
            }
            ```
          </script>

        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
            ### Smashing containers together

            Calling `openSession` with our credentials now returns a `Try[Long]`; this encodes the idea
            of an operation that might fail with an exception.

            It seems like we need to match on the result to find out whether it was successful or not.

            What use is that when we only need a session ID `Long` to perform any of our operations? Aren't we meant to be reducing the complexity of our code?

        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
            ### Composition with `Try[_]`

            ```scala
            def flatMap[A](f: A => Try[B]): Try[B]
            ```

            `Try` offers a higher-order function `flatMap`, which behaves as follows:

            If our `Try[A]` is a `Success[A]`, `flatMap` applies `f` to the `A` that was
            produced.

            If our `Try[A]` is a `Failure[A]`, this function does nothing.

            This means we can follow our `Try` with another operation,
            as long as the final result is still a `Try`.
          </script>
        </section>

        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
            ### Failing Fast

            In service-oriented architectures, we generally only care whether an entire
            operation succeeds or fails.

            After the operation returns we serialize the result and return it to the
            consumer of our API regardless of the outcome.

            The `flatMap` function stops at the first error and returns `Failure` for
            all succeeding operations.

            This makes it ideal for sequencing effects which might fail.

            ### Monads

            From our narrow software developer's point of view, `Try` is a monad.

            ### A crash course in monads

            Let's ignore the general atmosphere of confusion that surrounds this word.

            A monad is just some type `F[_]` which computes zero or more results of type `A` - an `F[A]`.

            The `F[_]` that we choose for our `F[A]` determines how to produce an `A` and how to apply operations to its contents:

            There are three basic operations which a monadic type must support.

          <script type="text/template">
            ### `pure`, also known as `return` or `point`

            `def pure[A](a: A): F[A]`

            This operation puts an `A` into the computation. This is sometimes called "lifting" `A` into our computation in `F[_]`.

            Outside of library code we would usually use a constructor directly instead as we usually know our `F[_]` in advance.

          <script type="text/template">
            ### `map`, also known as `fmap` or `<$>`

            `def map[A](f: A => B): F[B]`

            This operation modifies the `A` inside the computation using the function `f` to return a new computation that computes zero or more `B`.

            ```scala
            scala> Option(1) map { _ + 1 }
            res0: Option[Int] = Some(2)

            scala> List(1, 2) map { _ + 1 }
            res1: List[Int] = List(2, 3)
            ```

        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
            ### `flatMap`, also known as `>>=` or `bind`

            `def flatMap[A](f: A => F[B]): F[B]`

            This operation continues the computation `F[A]` with a new computation `F[B]`, which may be derived from the result `A` of `F[A]`.

            ```scala
            scala> Option(2) flatMap { i => Option(i * 2) }
            res3: Option[Int] = Some(4)

            scala> List(2, 4) flatMap { i => List(i * i, i * i * i) }
            res5: List[Int] = List(4, 8, 16, 64)

            scala> Option.empty[Int] flatMap { i => Option(i * 2) }
            res6: Option[Int] = None
            ```

            ### Disclaimer:

            This is an extremely informal definition and we will not discuss the associated laws, or the relationship of each operation to
            other constructs.

        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
            ### Example: `Option[_]`, also known as `Maybe`

            An `Option[A]` may be `Some[A]` or `None`. Therefore, it produces at most one `A`, and applies the function given to `map` only if it is `Some[A]`, in other words if there is an `A` to update.

            Likewise it continues the computation with `flatMap` only if the initial computation produced `Some[A]`.

            ### Optional optional values

            ```scala
            val smsNotificationNumber: Option[TelephoneNumber] =
              order.account flatMap { account => account.telephoneNumber }
            ```
            This type allows us to deal with multiple layers of optional values: for example, users might have the option to enter their mobile phone number on an optional account registration step when placing orders on an eCommerce site.
          </script>
        </section>

        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
            ### Example: `List[_]`

            By contrast, a `List[A]` may produce many `A` or none at all, and applies the function given to `map` to each value that it contains to produce a `List[B]`.

            It continues the computation with `flatMap` by producing a new `List[B]` from each `A` and joining them all together to produce a final `List[B]`.
          </script>
        </section>

        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
            ### A pattern

            There is a pattern emerging: monadic code allows us to express the idea of computation as a series of steps, each of which depends on the result of the
            previous step.
          </script>
        </section>

        <section data-markdown>

            ### Back to our API
            ```scala
            val trySearch =
              openSession("david", "fpnortheast") flatMap { sid =>
                searchThings(sid, "ble") flatMap { things =>
                  closeSession(sid) map (_ => things)
                }
              }
            ```
            This does not immediately look like an improvement. We've generalised the idea of the callback that continued the program using the function `flatMap`. The code otherwise looks the same.

            Crucially though, we are now returning a value that carries a lot more information about the execution of our program.

                  closeSession(sid) map (_ => things)

            val trySearch = for {
              sid <- openSession("david", "fpnortheast")

            Haskell's `do` / Scala's `for` offer a way of writing code that would usually introduce nesting in a more familiar way.

            ```scala
            val tryService = new HappyTryService(initialData)
            import tryService._

            val trySearch = for {

                fail(s"Couldn't search things due to $exc")
            }
            ```
            We can handle errors just once at the end of our service's execution - much less traumatic.

            ### Problems

            This is synchronous code. We usually use callbacks to deal with some underlying asychrony so we have lost something here.

            It's still noisy. Only one line from our comprehension is doing useful work; the rest is resource management.

            ```scala

            trait FutureService {
              def openSession(username: String, password: String)(implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[Long]
              def searchThings(sessionId: Long, searchTerm: String)(implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[List[Thing]]
              def getAThing(sessionId: Long, thingId: String)(implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[Thing]
              def saveAThing(sessionId: Long, thing: Thing)(implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[Unit]

            ```scala
            def openSession(username: String, password: String)(implicit ec: ExecutionContext) =
              Future {
                val newSession = UUID.randomUUID.getLeastSignificantBits
                sessions += newSession
                newSession

                fail(s"Couldn't search things due to $exc")
            }
            ```
            Nearly identical to the previous code - we simply replaced a `match` on the result with the function `onComplete`.

            ### More problems
            Our cleanup actions might never run if our service fails in the middle:

            ```scala
            val futureSession = openSession("david", "fpnortheast")

            val futureSearch = for {
              sid <- futureSession
              things <- searchThings(sid, "ble")
            } yield things

            futureSearch onComplete {
              case _ => closeSession(sid)
            }

            futureSearch onComplete {
              case Success(things) =>
                things shouldBe List(Thing("indispensible"), Thing("irreplaceable"))
              case Failure(exc) => fail(s"Couldn't search things due to $exc")
            }
            ```
            The solution is not so nice, but generally this is an acceptable compromise.

            ### Type classes and ad-hoc polymorphism

            This will be familiar to Haskell users:

            `F[_]: Monad` === if there is some type `F[_]` which has a `Monad[F]` instance

            This constraint allows us to express the idea of a type that participates in
            certain behaviours without using subtyping.

            We can extend the set of types which participate in a set of behaviours
            without access to the original code - this is ad-hoc polumorphism.

            I won't go into the mechanics as they are in Scala because they're not much fun.

          ### We don't have to compromise

            Surely we can express the idea of acquiring and releasing resources in a way that allows asynchronous acquisition and release?

            ```scala
            trait Functor[F[_]] {
              def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]
            }

            trait Monad[F[_]] extends Functor[F] {
              def pure[A](a: A): F[A]
              def flatMap[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => F[B]): F[B]
            }

            abstract class Resource[F[_]: Monad, Source, Handle] {
              def using[A](s: Source, session: Handle => F[A]): F[A]
            }

            ### Session

            If we can do that, surely we can lift any monadic type into a generalised `Session`?

            ```scala
            final case class Session[F[_], Source, Handle, A](
              session: Handle => F[A]
            )(implicit M: Monad[F], R: Resource[F, Source, Handle]) {

              def map[B](f: A => B): Session[F, Source, Handle, B] =
                Session(h => session(h) map f)

              def flatMap[B](f: A => Session[F, Source, Handle, B]): Session[F, Source, Handle, B] =
                Session(h => session(h) flatMap { f(_).session(h) })

              def run(s: Source) = R.using(s, session)
            }
            ```

          <script type="text/template">
          ### Limitations

          In Scala, `Session` is not particularly stack-safe, but this should not be
          a problem unless we're writing for comprehensions hundreds of lines long
          or folding large collections into `Session`.

          We could avert this by using a type that is trampolined like Scalaz' `Task`.

          Alternatively, we could write a trampolined `Session` ourselves - I'll leave this as an
          exercise for the reader.

            ### Conclusion
            By abstracting over concepts like callbacks and composition of effects,
            we can write code which is more predictable, can be composed together
            more easily and which better describes the results we can expect.

            We pay a price for this in conceptual difficulty and performance, but
            in service-oriented architectures the execution time of our code is
            typically dwarfed by IO.
